<p><b>Open Positions – Fall 2025</b></p>
</span>
<span style="font-size:10pt;">
<p>
The Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) is now accepting new members and collaborators for the upcoming academic term. We have openings for graduate research positions (2) and undergraduate research internships (2). Graduate research positions are open to students interested in AI, computer vision, machine learning, or cross-modal applications, and candidates may join either as students of The Korean Academy (such as TOPIK holders preparing for Korean university admission) or by demonstrating strong skills in programming (e.g., Python, machine learning frameworks, data science) and research. These positions are ideal for highly motivated individuals aiming to build a strong research profile for future graduate studies or international PhD programs, and for those willing to contribute to paper writing, model development, and experiments. Lab members will have access to resources such as dedicated workspace and equipment, and will receive guidance on research publishing and opportunities to co-author international conference or journal papers.
</p>
<p>
Undergraduate research internships are available for 3rd or 4th year undergraduates passionate about AI and seeking hands-on research experience. Interns will contribute to ongoing projects through programming, testing, dataset handling, and literature review, and will benefit from mentorship by graduate-level researchers, involvement in real research workflows, and recommendation or experience certificates for academic or industry applications. These internships are ideal for students planning to pursue higher education (MS/PhD) or to enter the IT industry with strong research and project experience.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in joining, please send an email with your CV, academic transcripts (undergraduate and/or graduate, if available), and a short research statement or project portfolio to <a href="mailto:gurpreetsinghmcse@gmail.com">gurpreetsinghmcse@gmail.com</a>. For questions or informal inquiries, feel free to reach out anytime.

<span style="font-size:10pt;">
  <p>
    The CAAI Lab (Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence) is an experimental eLAB focused on supporting students who are new to academic research and wish to enter the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and cross-modal systems. The lab is designed as a guided research environment where beginners can learn research methodologies, implementation practices, paper writing, and experimentation under structured mentorship.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAAI Lab operates under The Korean Academy, an MSME-registered organization in India. Through this association, the lab plays an important academic support role for students learning the Korean language and preparing for future academic or professional transitions to Korea or other countries. The lab environment is especially beneficial for students aiming to build a research profile while preparing for international higher education opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    CAAI Lab itself does charge any joining or participation fee. However, joining under The Korean Academy involving TOPIK Level 5 or Level 6 holders who are enrolled as students under The Korean Academy can join the lab with no charge, applicable academy-level policies may apply. Students who are new to research and wish to learn more about joining criteria or fee-related matters should refer to the official website of The Korean Academy or contact <a href="mailto:admission@thekoreancad.com">admission@thekoreancad.com</a> for accurate and updated information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Research projects at CAAI Lab typically span a duration of approximately three (3) months. Upon successful completion of the assigned research objectives and submission of a research paper or equivalent deliverable, eligible participants may receive a Certificate of Research Participation and, where appropriate, a Letter of Recommendation based on performance, contribution, and commitment.
  </p>
<p>
  <b>Policies, Governance, and Participation Terms</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Participation in CAAI Lab is purely academic, voluntary, and non-contractual in nature. Joining the lab does not establish an employer–employee relationship, legal partnership, or guarantee of continued association.
  </li>

  <li>
    Admission into CAAI Lab does not imply or guarantee publication acceptance, conference presentation, journal indexing, funding, employment, visa approval, university admission, scholarships, or any other academic or professional outcome.
  </li>

  <li>
    All research activities are conducted on a best-effort basis. Research timelines, deliverables, and outcomes may vary depending on project complexity, participant performance, external review processes, and unforeseen technical or academic constraints.
  </li>

  <li>
    Participants are required to maintain consistent engagement, attend scheduled meetings (online or offline), complete assigned tasks, and follow research guidance. Repeated non-participation, unresponsiveness, or failure to meet deadlines may result in removal from the project without prior notice.
  </li>

  <li>
    If a participant voluntarily withdraws, becomes inactive, or fails to complete the research project, CAAI Lab reserves the full right to:
    <ul>
      <li>Exclude the participant from authorship or acknowledgments</li>
      <li>Withhold certificates, recommendation letters, or official confirmation</li>
      <li>Reassign or discontinue the participant’s research responsibilities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Research certificates, experience letters, and recommendation letters are issued strictly at the discretion of CAAI Lab and are contingent upon successful project completion, quality of contribution, ethical conduct, and adherence to lab policies.
  </li>

  <li>
    Authorship on research papers is determined solely based on meaningful intellectual, technical, and experimental contributions, in accordance with standard academic ethics. Financial contribution, enrollment status, or duration of association does not automatically qualify a participant for authorship.
  </li>

  <li>
    All participants must adhere to strict academic integrity standards. Plagiarism, data manipulation, misrepresentation of results, unauthorized use of datasets or models, or violation of publication ethics will result in immediate termination from the lab and possible reporting to relevant academic bodies.
  </li>

  <li>
    CAAI Lab retains the right to use research outputs, anonymized data, experimental results, and project descriptions for academic, educational, and promotional purposes, while respecting confidentiality and ethical guidelines.
  </li>

  <li>
    Any tools, models, datasets, or intellectual property developed during the project may remain under the ownership or joint ownership of CAAI Lab, subject to institutional, journal, or conference policies. Participants waive any claim to exclusive ownership unless otherwise agreed in writing.
  </li>

  <li>
    CAAI Lab shall not be held liable for external decisions made by universities, immigration authorities, employers, publishers, or funding agencies based on research participation, certificates, or recommendation letters.
  </li>

  <li>
