<p><b>Open Positions – Fall 2025</b></p>
</span>
<span style="font-size:10pt;">
<p>
The Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) is now accepting new members and collaborators for the upcoming academic term. We have openings for graduate research positions (2) and undergraduate research internships (2). Graduate research positions are open to students interested in AI, computer vision, machine learning, or cross-modal applications, and candidates may join either as students of The Korean Academy (such as TOPIK holders preparing for Korean university admission) or by demonstrating strong skills in programming (e.g., Python, machine learning frameworks, data science) and research. These positions are ideal for highly motivated individuals aiming to build a strong research profile for future graduate studies or international PhD programs, and for those willing to contribute to paper writing, model development, and experiments. Lab members will have access to resources such as dedicated workspace and equipment, and will receive guidance on research publishing and opportunities to co-author international conference or journal papers.
</p>
<p>
Undergraduate research internships are available for 3rd or 4th year undergraduates passionate about AI and seeking hands-on research experience. Interns will contribute to ongoing projects through programming, testing, dataset handling, and literature review, and will benefit from mentorship by graduate-level researchers, involvement in real research workflows, and recommendation or experience certificates for academic or industry applications. These internships are ideal for students planning to pursue higher education (MS/PhD) or to enter the IT industry with strong research and project experience.
</p>
<p>
If you are interested in joining, please send an email with your CV, academic transcripts (undergraduate and/or graduate, if available), and a short research statement or project portfolio to <a href="mailto:gurpreetsinghmcse@gmail.com">gurpreetsinghmcse@gmail.com</a>. For questions or informal inquiries, feel free to reach out anytime.
