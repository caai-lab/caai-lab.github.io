<p>[7] Text-to-Audio (T2A) Generation under CAAI (2025): This cross-modal research project explores the generation of audio from textual inputs using a variety of models and deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study aims to improve semantic understanding and audio synthesis in text-driven audio generation systems.</p>


<p>[6] AI-Assisted Storytelling Generation under CAAI (2025): This cross-modal research project explores AI-assisted storytelling generation using a range of models and deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study focuses on integrating narrative structure, creativity, and multimodal learning to enhance automated storytelling systems.</p>


<p>[5] Visual-to-Audio (V2A) Generation under CAAI (2025): This cross-modal research project explores the generation of audio from visual inputs by leveraging techniques in computer vision, CNNs, RNNs, and Vision Transformers (ViT). Initiated under CAAI, the study aims to advance cross-modality by developing models capable of interpreting visual stimuli and generating corresponding audio representations.</p>

<p>[3] Business Growth and Management Research Team Formation (2023 - 2024, finished): In 2023, a research team was formed to explore the intersection of business growth, management, and AI. Members Simran Singh, Nahid Rehmani, Pushpa Kumari, and Vedha Varshini worked on projects that applied AI-driven analytics to optimize business strategies and foster innovation across industries. The project was successfully completed in 2024.</p>

<p>[2] Cybersecurity and AI: Assessing Vulnerabilities in Modern Infrastructure (Spring 2024): Gurpreet Singh and Prof. Saurabh Singh conducted an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities and impacts of open SSH ports on CENTOS 9 virtual machines hosted on Mac ARM computers (CVE-2023-25136). The research provides practical recommendations for securing cloud and virtualized environments in the age of AI-driven cyber threats.</p>

<p>[1] ChatGPT and Cybersecurity: Implications and Repercussions (2022): In collaboration with Prof. Preethi Ananthachari, Gurpreet Singh explored the impact of large language models like ChatGPT on cybersecurity. The project, published in a leading journal, discusses both the opportunities and risks posed by generative AI in the context of digital security and privacy.</p>
