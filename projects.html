<p>[2] Business Growth and Management Research Team Formation (2023 - 2024, finished): In 2023, a research team was formed to explore the intersection of business growth, management, and AI. Members Simran Singh, Nahid Rehmani, Pushpa Kumari, and Vedha Varshini worked on projects that applied AI-driven analytics to optimize business strategies and foster innovation across industries. The project was successfully completed in 2024.</p>

<p>[3] Cybersecurity and AI: Assessing Vulnerabilities in Modern Infrastructure (Spring 2024): Gurpreet Singh and Prof. Saurabh Singh conducted an in-depth analysis of the vulnerabilities and impacts of open SSH ports on CENTOS 9 virtual machines hosted on Mac ARM computers (CVE-2023-25136). The research provides practical recommendations for securing cloud and virtualized environments in the age of AI-driven cyber threats.</p>

<p>[4] ChatGPT and Cybersecurity: Implications and Repercussions (2022): In collaboration with Prof. Preethi Ananthachari, Gurpreet Singh explored the impact of large language models like ChatGPT on cybersecurity. The project, published in a leading journal, discusses both the opportunities and risks posed by generative AI in the context of digital security and privacy.</p>
